2. **Development Server**:  
   Run `ng serve` for a local development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the website.

## Acknowledgments and Areas for Improvement

I recognize that there are several areas where this project could be further enhanced. These include:

- **Using Angular 18**: This project was developed using Angular 18. As this is my first time using Angular, I initially followed the documentation and realized I was working with Angular 18 instead of Angular 17. Due to time constraint and having to reconfigure settings potentially risking the fucntionlaity of the project, I decided to continue to work usign Angular 18. I understand that this was a mistake on my part, and I hope it does not detract from the quality of my application.

- **Adding Animations**: Incorporating animations would improve user interactions and make the experience more engaging.

Due to time constraints and the main focus on the overall design, I was unable to implement these enhancements fully.

I am eager to further improve my skills and knowledge by learning from experienced developers in your company as a frontend developer intern and contribute to it too. This opportunity would provide invaluable insights and mentorship that I believe would significantly contribute to my growth in web development.
