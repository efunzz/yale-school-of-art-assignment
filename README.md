# Yale School of Art Redesign

This project is a redesign concept for the Yale School of Art website, created with angular. The aim is to demonstrate UI/UX design skills and Angular coding ability by enhancing the existing site.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to redesign the Yale School of Art website with a focus on improving user experience, refreshing the UI, and establishing a new brand identity. This concept leverages the existing content and assets but provides a fresh, intuitive, and engaging design.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **GitHub**
- **GitHub Desktop**

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository**:  
   First, copy the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

   ```

2. **Development Server**:  
   Run `ng serve` for a local development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the website.

## Acknowledgments and Areas for Improvement

I recognize that there are several areas where this project could be further enhanced. These include:

- **Adding Animations**: Incorporating animations would improve user interactions and make the experience more engaging.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: While the design is functional on desktop, further refinements for mobile responsiveness.

Due to time constraints and the main focus on the overall design, I was unable to implement these enhancements fully.

I am eager to further improve my skills and knowledge by learning from experienced developers in your company as a frontend developer intern and contribute to it too. This opportunity would provide invaluable insights and mentorship that I believe would significantly contribute to my growth in web development.
